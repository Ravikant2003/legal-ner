The case was heard in the Delhi High Court before Hon’ble Justice Ramesh Chandra.\n\nThe petitioner contended that his fundamental rights under Article 19(1)(a) were infringed due to arbitrary arrests made under Section 66A. In his arguments, he cited the precedent laid down in Shreya Singhal vs Union of India, (2015) 5 SCC 1.\n\nThe respondents, represented by Advocate General Ms. Neha Sharma, argued that the statute was necessary for maintaining public order and cyber discipline.\n\nThe court, after hearing the arguments on multiple dates including 22nd April 2021, 1st May 2021, and 15th May 2021, reserved its judgment.\n\nOn 30th May 2021, the Delhi High Court ruled that Section 66A was unconstitutional and struck it down. The judgment emphasized the importance of protecting free speech in a digital democracy.\n\nThe witness, Mr. Karan Thapar, a cyber law expert, also testified during the hearing, affirming the misuse of the provision by law enforcement agencies.\n\nFurther directions were issued to the Ministry of Home Affairs and the Cyber Crime Unit to review all cases filed under the repealed provision.\n\nThe case has now been escalated to the Supreme Court for a larger constitutional bench review.\n\"\"\"\nresults = ner_pipeline(text)\n\n# Display results\nfor r in results:\n    print(f\"{r['word']} --> {r['entity_group']} ({r['score']:.2f})\")\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-09T11:54:05.678435Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-09T11:54:05.678676Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-09T11:54:06.193879Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-09T11:54:05.678660Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-09T11:54:06.193259Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"Device set to use cuda:0\n","output_type":"stream"},{"name":"stdout","text":"court of india civil --> COURT (0.87)\nappeal no. 2345 of 2021 the --> CASE_NUMBER (0.67)\n##iv mehta, --> OTHER_PERSON (0.66)\nof india on --> ORG (0.81)\nmarch 2021, --> DATE (0.98)\n66a of --> PROVISION (0.99)\ntechnology act, 2000. --> STATUTE (0.98)\nhigh court before --> COURT (0.97)\n##esh chandra. --> JUDGE (0.87)\n19 ( 1 ) ( a ) were --> PROVISION (0.98)\n66a. --> PROVISION (0.97)\n##reya singhal vs union of india, ( 2015 ) 5 scc 1. --> PRECEDENT (0.96)\n##ha sharma, --> OTHER_PERSON (0.78)\napril 2021, --> DATE (0.97)\nmay 2021, --> DATE (0.93)\nmay 2021, --> DATE (0.96)\nmay 2021, --> DATE (0.97)\nhigh court ruled --> COURT (0.98)\n66a was --> PROVISION (0.90)\n##n thapar, --> OTHER_PERSON (0.42)\nof home affairs and --> COURT (0.67)\ncrime --> ORG (0.49)\nunit to --> COURT (0.53)\ncourt for --> COURT (0.98)\n","output_type":"stream"}],"execution_count":16},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from transformers import AutoModelForTokenClassification, AutoTokenizer\nimport torch\n\nmodel_path = \"/kaggle/working/ner_model\"\n\nmodel = AutoModelForTokenClassification.from_pretrained(model_path)\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(model_path)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-09T11:57:54.759839Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-09T11:57:54.760482Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-09T11:57:54.877573Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-09T11:57:54.760430Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-09T11:57:54.877010Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":20},{"cell_type":"code","source":"import json\n\nwith open(\"/kaggle/input/ner-mini/label2id_Judgement_Train.json\") as f:\n    label2id = json.load(f)\n\nid2label = {v: k for k, v in label2id.items()}\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-09T11:57:56.784654Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-09T11:57:56.785304Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-09T11:57:56.790811Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-09T11:57:56.785284Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-09T11:57:56.790247Z"}},"outputs":[],"execution_count":21},{"cell_type":"code","source":"from sklearn.metrics import classification_report\n\ndef evaluate_model(model, eval_dataset, id2label):\n    model.eval()\n    predictions = []\n    references = []\n\n    for sample in eval_dataset:\n        input_ids = torch.tensor([sample[\"input_ids\"]])\n        attention_mask = torch.tensor([sample[\"attention_mask\"]])\n\n        #labels = sample[\"labels\"]\n        labels = torch.tensor(sample[\"labels\"])\n\n        with torch.no_grad():\n            output = model(input_ids=input_ids, attention_mask=attention_mask)\n        \n        logits = output.logits\n        preds = torch.argmax(logits, dim=2).squeeze().tolist()\n        labels = labels.tolist()\n\n        # Remove padding (-100) from both\n        filtered_preds = [id2label[p] for p, l in zip(preds, labels) if l != -100]\n        filtered_labels = [id2label[l] for l in labels if l != -100]\n\n        predictions.extend(filtered_preds)\n        references.extend(filtered_labels)\n\n    print(classification_report(references, predictions, digits=4))\n\nevaluate_model(model, eval_dataset, id2label)\n","metadata":{"trusted":true,"execution":{"iopub.status.busy":"2025-05-09T11:57:58.317846Z","iopub.execute_input":"2025-05-09T11:57:58.318120Z","iopub.status.idle":"2025-05-09T12:05:28.849097Z","shell.execute_reply.started":"2025-05-09T11:57:58.318100Z","shell.execute_reply":"2025-05-09T12:05:28.848257Z"}},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","text":"/usr/local/lib/python3.11/dist-packages/sklearn/metrics/_classification.py:1344: UndefinedMetricWarning: Precision and F-score are ill-defined and being set to 0.0 in labels with no predicted samples.
